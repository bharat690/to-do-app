### 👨‍💻 About Us

**Bharat Rai** , **Ayush Kumar Sahani** and **Ayushmaan Kaithwar** built this project as the **End Semester Project** for the course **Logic Building with Python** 🎓.

We took this as an opportunity to go beyond the basics and craft something meaningful, useful, and fun — a productivity app that blends logic, data, and real-world value.

## 💡 Why We Built This
As part of our Logic Building with Python course, we wanted to go beyond console apps. We aimed to create a fully interactive, intelligent, and visually engaging productivity system. This was our first real-world full-stack Python project — and we made it awesome.
